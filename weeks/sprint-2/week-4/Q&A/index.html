      <p class="header">Question:</p>
      <p>What's the best way to handle timezones in JavaScript?</p>
      <p>
        And according to https://technigo-weagther-app-design-01.netlify.app/
        the temperature in sydney on saturday is 19 celsius, while google says
        highest temperature will be 27.
      </p>
      <p class="header">Answer:</p>
      <p>Let's look at the code to see how to show date based on timezone</p>
      <p>
        Regarding the temperature, the instructions said: Feature: Weather
        forecast ðŸ“… Show a forecast for the next 5 days. You can choose how to
        display the forecast - perhaps you want to show the min and max
        temperature for each day, or perhaps you want to show the temperature
        from the middle of the day, or the humidity, what it feels like and so
        on.
      </p>
      <p>We are showing the average temperature.</p>

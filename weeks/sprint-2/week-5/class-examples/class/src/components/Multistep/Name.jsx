/* The provided code defines a React component named `Name`. 
This component is designed for capturing and displaying a user's name. Let me explain what this code does step by step:

1. **Component Declaration**:
   - This is a functional React component named `Name`.
   - It receives two props: `value` and `updateFormData`.

2. **Prop Explanations**:
   - `value`: This prop likely represents the current value of the name input field. 
   It's used to set the initial value of the `<input>` element.
   - `updateFormData`: This prop is a function that is intended to be called whenever the name input is changed. 
   It's meant to update some form data in a parent component, and it takes two arguments: the name of the field being updated ("name" in this case) and the new value.

3. **Event Handling Function**:
   - Inside the `Name` component, there's a function called `userName`.
    It's an arrow function that takes an event object (`e`) as its parameter.
   - When the input field's value changes (when a user types something in), the `onChange` event is triggered,
    and it calls the `userName` function.

4. **Rendered JSX**:
   - The component returns a `<div>` element that contains a `<label>` with the text "Name" and an `<input>` element.
   - The `value` prop is used to set the initial value of the `<input>`.
   - The `onChange` event of the `<input>` is set to the `userName` function, 
   which will be called when the user types in their name.

5. **Updating Form Data**:
   - When the user types in their name, the `userName` function is called.
   - This function, in turn, calls the `updateFormData` function, passing "name" as the name of the field being updated 
   and `e.target.value` as the new value. This effectively updates the name field in the parent component's form data.

 */

/* the Name component is responsible for rendering an input field for the user's name. 
When the user types in their name, the updateFormData function is called, 
which allows the parent component to manage and update the form data with the new name value. 
This is a common pattern in React for building controlled input components where the parent component
 maintains the state and handles data changes. */

      <h3>How to connect your HTML with your JS code ?</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start by adding a script tag right before our CLOSING body tag,
        make sure to add the "defer" attribute on the opening script tag.
      </p>
      <h3>What does the defer attribute mean?</h3>
      <p>
        In simple terms, the defer attribute within a script tag tells the web
        browser to load and execute the script after the HTML content has been
        fully parsed and displayed on the screen
      </p>
    </div>
    <script src="./4-conditionals.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>

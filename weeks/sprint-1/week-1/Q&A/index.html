        When using promt to ask user for their name, should you use const or
        let? Since the name is gonna change, it makes sense to use let. But the
        promt message are always gonna be the same, so using const would also
        make sense. It's just the input changing, right?
      </p>

        It depends!
        When storing a value, we need to think what is the data that we need to save and use somewhere in the code, 
        so in this case we need to be able to do something with the name (use in the greeting), therefore we need to think if the name will be a value that needs to be replaced or not, 
        based on that we use let or const.<br/>
    
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Use const when you can, and use let when you have to.</p>

        This means that if you can initialize a variable when you declare it, and don't need to reassign it later, make it a constant.  <br/>

        When we have pair or group assignments, do we use our partners / group mates or will they be assigned?
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be informed week by week. If it's a pair project, we will divide you in pairs and you will find all the info on Notion.          <br/>
        <br/> Same if it's a group project, there will be a section with the name of the people involved in each project!

        When should I use <code>git push</code> and <code>git push origin master</code> in the terminal? <br/>
        <br/> I weren't able to push the changes with <code>git push origin master</code> but with only <code>git push</code> it worked and I'm curious to know why :)
      </p>
      <p class="header">Answer:</p>
      <p>
        You used the command <pre>git push origin master</pre> to try to push your code to a branch called <code >master</code>, but since your branch is called <code> main </code> you got an error. <br/>

        <br/>
        The commands <code>git push origin main</code> or just <code>git push</code> will work! <br/>
        <br/><code>git push</code> assumes that you already have a remote repository defined for that branch. In this case, the default remote origin is used.
